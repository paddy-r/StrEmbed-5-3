<i> StrEmbed-5-3 is a graphical user interface for visualisation and manipulation of part-whole relationships in assemblies of parts. It is written in Python and uses the modules listed in the "requirements" document. Functionality is based on [StrEmbed-4](https://github.com/hhchau/StrEmbed-4) (and earlier versions) by Hau Hing Chau, written in Perl.</i>  

<b>This research is supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under grant number EP/S016406/1.</b>

Two scripts are required:
1. StrEmbed_5_3
2. step_parse_5_3

It is recommended that you download the entire folder, which contains a users' manual. STEP files are used for data transfer and several examples are provided. In addition, for the torch example, part images are given in the 'Images' folder, where image names correspond to their product definitions in the STEP file; they are currently pre-rendered but will be generated automatically in the next version.

StrEmbed-5-3 was developed in Spyder, an IDE for Python that is packaged with the Anaconda distribution, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

StrEmbed-5-3 is published under the GNU General Purpose License version 3, which is given in the LICENSE document.
